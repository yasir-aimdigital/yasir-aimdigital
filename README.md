# Hi, I'm Yasir 👋

I'm a Jr. Web Developer and Computer Science grad with a passion for building cool things on the web!  
Currently rocking the MERN stack, Java, C#, .NET (ASP), and dabbling a bit in Python. I believe in clean code, continuous learning, and a dash of humor to keep things interesting.

## 💻 Skills

- **Languages/Frameworks:** JavaScript (MERN), Java, C#, .NET (ASP), Python (a sprinkle)
- **Web Tech:** React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Other:** Git, REST APIs, Agile basics

## 🚀 Projects

### 🌟 Marketplace Platform
Built a full-fledged marketplace as part of my final year projects (FYPs) using the MERN stack.  
It taught me a lot about real-world problem solving and making users (and professors) happy!

## 😄 Fun Fact

I code like a professional but debug like a comedian.  
Let’s build something awesome (and maybe break it for laughs)!
